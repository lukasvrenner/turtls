# TurTLS üê¢

## A work-in-progress TLS 1.3 dynamic library
Note: Although turtls is written in Rust, it only provides a C API.

WARNING: This code has not been audited. Use it at your own risk.
================================================================

## Features
1. Simple API -- the TurTLS API only contains a few functions:
- `turtls_generate_config`: Generate the default configuration struct.
- `turtls_alloc`: Allocate the connection state buffer.
- `turtls_free`: Free the connection state buffer.
- `turtls_connect`: Perform the TLS handshake as the client.
- `turtls_accept`: Perform the TLS handshake as the server (not yet implemented).
- `turtls_send`: send data to the peer (not yet implemented).
- `turtls_read`: read data from the peer (not yet implemented).
- `turtls_close`: close the connection.
- `turtls_stringify_alert`: return a string representation of a TLS alert (not yet implement).
2. Configuration struct: all configuration is done via a single config struct
3. AEADs:
- [AES-* GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode)
- [ChaCha20Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305)
4. ECC:
- [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm)
- [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)
- Curves: secp256r1 (NIST-P 256)
5. Hash:
- [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
- [SHA-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
- [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC)
- [HKDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF)


## Cryptography
TurTLS uses in-house cryptography, meaning it uses its own crypto library, called crylib.
crylib can also be used independently of TurTLS.

## Building
Make sure you have a recent version of Rust installed. This project uses on new language features as they release,
so make sure your version is recent enough.

To build in debug mode:
```bash
cargo build
```

To build in release mode:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

Move `libturtls.so` from `./target/debug/` -- debug -- or `./target/release/` -- release to the desired directory.
