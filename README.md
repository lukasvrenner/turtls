# TurTLS üê¢

## A work-in-progress TLS 1.3 dynamic library
Note: Although turtls is written in Rust, it only provides a C API.

WARNING: This code has not been audited. Use it at your own risk.
================================================================

## Features
See `./ROADMAP.md` for a roadmap and complete list of features

### API
1. The TurTLS API only contains a few functions:
- `turtls_generate_config`: Generate the default configuration struct.
- `turtls_alloc`: Allocate the connection state buffer.
- `turtls_free`: Free the connection state buffer.
- `turtls_connect`: Perform the TLS handshake as the client.
- `turtls_accept`: Perform the TLS handshake as the server (not yet implemented).
- `turtls_send`: send data to the peer (not yet implemented).
- `turtls_read`: read data from the peer (not yet implemented).
- `turtls_close`: close the connection.
- `turtls_stringify_alert`: return a string representation of a TLS alert (not yet implement).
2. Configuration struct: all configuration is done via a single config struct

### Cryptography
TurTLS uses in-house cryptography, meaning it uses its own crypto library, called crylib.
crylib can also be used independently of TurTLS.

## Building
Make sure you have a recent version of Rust installed. This project uses on new language features as they release,
so make sure your version is recent enough.

To build in debug mode:
```bash
cargo build
```

To build in release mode:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

Move `libturtls.so` from `./target/debug/` -- debug -- or `./target/release/` -- release to the desired directory.
